    WHAT IT IS ABOUT
    
1::the first folder is a small form that builds a url with your edited phone number and a message variable is concatenated in the url.
The page redirects to the whatsapp website. then you click "continue"

2::The second folder is also a form that returns a link to your whatsapp inbox . 
it only works with kenyan phone numbers for now.
